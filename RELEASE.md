# How to release Authorino Operator

## Process

To release a version _“v0.W.Z”_ of Authorino Operator in GitHub and Quay.io, follow these steps:

1. Pick a stable (released) version _“v0.X.Y”_ of the operand known to be compatible with operator’s image for _“v0.W.Z_”;
if needed, [make a release of the operand first](https://github.com/Kuadrant/authorino/blob/main/RELEASE.md).

2. Run the GHA [Release operator](https://github.com/Kuadrant/authorino-operator/actions/workflows/release.yaml); make
sure to fill all the fields:

   * Branch containing the release workflow file – default: `main`
   * Commit SHA or branch name of the operator to release – usually: `main`
   * Operator version to release (without prefix) – i.e. `0.W.Z`
   * Authorino version the operator enables installations of (without prefix) – i.e. `0.X.Y`
   * If the release is a prerelease
   * Bundle and catalog channels (comma-separated) – usually: `stable`

3. Run the GHA [Build and push images](https://github.com/Kuadrant/authorino-operator/actions/workflows/build-images.yaml)
for the _“v0.W.Z”_ tag, specifying ‘Authorino version’ equals to _“0.X.Y”_ (without the leading “v”). This will cause the
new images (bundle and catalog included) to be built and pushed to the corresponding repos in
[quay.io/kuadrant](https://quay.io/organization/kuadrant).


### Publishing the Operator in OpenShift Community Operators
Open a PR in the [OpenShift Community Operators repo](http://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod)
([example](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod/pull/1595) |
[docs](https://redhat-openshift-ecosystem.github.io/community-operators-prod/operator-release-process/)).

The usual steps are:

1. Start a new branch named `authorino-operator-v0.W.Z`

2. Create a new directory `operators/authorino-operator/0.W.Z` containing:

   * Copy the bundle files from `github.com/kuadrant/authorino-operator/tree/v0.W.Z/bundle`
   * Copy `github.com/kuadrant/authorino-operator/tree/v0.W.Z/bundle.Dockerfile` with the proper fix to the COPY commands
   (i.e. remove /bundle from the paths)

### Publishing the Operator in Kubernetes Community Operators (OperatorHub.io)

1. Open a PR in the [Kubernetes Community Operators repo](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators)
([example](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators/pull/1655) | [docs](https://operatorhub.io/contribute)).

2. The usual steps are the same as for the
[OpenShift Community Operators](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tLveyv8Zwe0wKyfUTWOlEnFeMB5aVGqIVDUjVYWax0U/edit#heading=h.b5tapxn4sbk5)
hub.


## Notes on Authorino Operator’s automated builds and references to the Authorino manifests and default version

* PRs merged to the main branch of Authorino Operator cause a new image to be built (GH Action) and pushed automatically
to `quay.io/kuadrant/authorino-operator:<git-ref>` – the `quay.io/kuadrant/authorino-operator:latest` tag is also moved
to match the latest <git-ref>.

* Authorino Operator owns the manifests generated by the operator itself (i.e. Authorino CRD, RBAC), and stores a copy
  of the operand’s manifests (AuthConfig CRD, RBAC):

  * All resources are added to the bundle manifests (`./bundle`) – for installations managed with
  [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://olm.operatorframework.io/)
  * A single file manifest is generated at `./config/deploy/manifests.yaml`, gathering the resources to install and deploy
  the Operator without OLM
    * Allows installing (CRDs, RBAC) and deploying (Deployment, Services) an instance of the operator from a single
    `kubectl apply` command
    * Tons of Authorino docs and examples rely on this
  * The `manifests` make target is used to generate the compiled version of all manifests (operator’s and operand’s).
  It accepts as parameters:
  
    * `VERSION`: sets the version of the manifests of the operator generated by the operator-sdk command and image tag of
    the deployment added to `config/deploy/manifests.yaml` (default: latest)
    * `AUTHORINO_VERSION`: sets the operand’s branch that sources the manifests (CRD, role definitions) that are appended
    to `config/deploy/manifests.yaml` (default: latest)
  
  * Changes in the operand’s CRD/role definitions out date the `config/deploy/manifests.yaml` file, thus requiring a PR to
  the operator repo ([example](https://github.com/Kuadrant/authorino-operator/pull/68))
  
  * The `verify-manifests` make target is used to verify consistency of the manifests
    * Triggered in the CI tests
    * Causes all PRs in the Operator repo to break whenever there’s a change in the operand’s API committed to the main
    branch → requires immediate update of the copy of operand’s manifests in the main branch of the operator and rebase
    of all PRs
    
* Apart from the operand’s manifests pinned to a specific or latest version in the copy committed to
`config/deploy/manifests.yaml`, the Operator’s code contains hard-coded references to the default version of the operand
to install:
  * Set at compilation time ([`controllers.DefaultAuthorinoImage`](https://github.com/Kuadrant/authorino-operator/blob/03b42633627337bc7d908e36e579340a0d8e12fb/controllers/constants.go#L95))
  * Configured in the `build.yaml` file ([example](https://github.com/Kuadrant/authorino-operator/blob/release-v0.10.0/build.yaml))
  * It can be overwritten in the Authorino CR → good for dev/test/staging workflows
  * Set to "latest" in the main branch
